# Drum Kit Website

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a personal projectâ€”a drum kit website powered by JavaScript. It was developed as part of the JavaScript30 course created by Wes Bos.

JavaScript30 is a free online course that aims to strengthen participants' JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects in 30 days. This drum kit website is one of those projects, designed to enhance your understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The drum kit website allows users to play various drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboards or clicking on the drum kit interface. It provides an interactive and engaging experience for users interested in music or learning JavaScript.

By exploring this repository, you will find the complete source code for the drum kit website, along with any necessary assets and resources. You can use this code as a reference, study material, or even contribute to its further development.
